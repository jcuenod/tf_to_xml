# Convert Text-Fabric data to XML

This repo is specifically for converting [bhsa 2017](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa) to xml data for use with Jonathan Robie's approach to interacting with biblical data seen, for example, [here](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament/blob/master/labnotes/lxml-tutorial.ipynb).

You will need the osis book names to be available to your tf installation (mine was in my tf directory so I've copied it here). If you just paste it into `bhsa/tf/2017` it should work as expected.
